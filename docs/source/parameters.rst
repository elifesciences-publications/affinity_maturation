Setting model parameters
========================

The model presented in [Molari2020]_ was based on experimental data collected on mice immunization against Tetanus Toxoid. However, depending on the organism / setup one considers one might want to adapt the value of many of the model parameters. To do so, here is a description of the parameters, their standard value in our model and instructions on how to change them.

.. _par_dict:

The parameters dictionary
_________________________

The value of all the model parameters is included in a single python dictionary. In this way values of single parameters are easy to modify and pass to the library functions. Whenever a function accepts a :obj:`par` argument, this consist of the model parameters dictionary.

Here is a table with a non-exhaustive list of the most important model parameters. For a more complete list one can refer to the :file:`model_parameters.py` `file <param_file_>`_. In the table each parameter is accompanied by the corresponding label in the parameters dictionary, its standard [1]_ value and a small description.

Create and modify your parameters dictionary
____________________________________________

A dictionary containing the standard value for all parameters can be obtained with the function :func:`st_par`. Values of single parameters can be then modified using their labels::

    #Â dictionary with the standard value of model parameters
    par = am_sim.st_par()

    # modify one specific parameter
    par['mu_i'] = -13.


.. _exp_range:

Experimental sensitivity range
______________________________

For a good comparison between experimental data and results of the simulations some of the functions of the library take into account the experimental sensitivity range. The limit of this range are set through the parameters :obj:`low_en_exp_cutoff` and :obj:`high_en_exp_cutoff` to be respectively 0.1 and 500 in nano-Molar units, or equivalently -23.03 and -14.51 in :math:`k_B T` energy units. They can be modified by changing their value in :file:`model_parameters.py` `file <param_file_>`_. Cells with lower affinity than 500 nM are considered as non-detectable, while cells with higher affinity than 0.1 nM are detected, but their affinity is by default set to 0.1 nM.
