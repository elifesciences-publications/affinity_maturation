# Affinity maturation simulation

This repository contains the code for the simulations and figures featured in the paper *Quantitative modeling of the effect of antigen dosage on the distribution of B-cell affinities in maturating germinal centers Supplementary Information*, by Marco Molari, Klaus Eyer, Jean Baudry, Simona Cocco, and Rémi Monasson.

## Repository structure:

- The folder `am_sim` contains the library with most of the code core functions
- The folder `data` contains the dataset files containing experimental measurements for each immunization scheme.
