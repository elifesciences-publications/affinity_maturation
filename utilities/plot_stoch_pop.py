def plot_error_area(ax, stoch_pop_avgs_list, N_GCs, x):
    '''
    This function plots on the specified axis the confidence interval for
    stochastic simulations. The interval is plotted as a green shaded area,
    spanning one standard deviation above and below the mean. The standard
    deviation is corrected with the square root of the number of GCs that we
    expect to measure.

    Args:
    - ax: ax object on which to plot.
    - stoch_pop_avgs_list (list of lists of float): list of list of
        measurements of the quantity, which can be either average binding
        energy or high-affinity fraction.
    - N_GCs (int): number of GCs we expect to measure on each mouse.
    - x (list of floats): x-domain of the plot. Same dimension as the number of
        lists in stoch_pop_avgs_list.
